My model uses data from Planet that can be found on Kaggle here:
https://www.kaggle.com/nikitarom/planets-dataset
And originally came from this competition:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space

If you download the data  you can run the Jupyter notebook, feel free to adjust
the size of the training, validation, and test sets to make it run faster.
Currently it takes about an hour to run. HTML and pdf versions are included with
output for your convenience.
